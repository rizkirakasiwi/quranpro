# Local Storage Strategy with `LocalStorageData`

## 🧩 Overview

This architecture leverages the **Strategy Pattern** to abstract local storage operations, allowing easy switching between different backends (e.g., `HiveStorage`, `SharedPreferences`, or custom ones). At its core, `LocalStorageData` defines the blueprint for objects that can be saved, retrieved, or deleted from local storage.

You interact with helper functions like `localStorage.save`, `localStorage.get`, etc., making your code clean, reusable, and backend-agnostic.

---

## 🔐 Implementing `LocalStorageData`

To store any object in local storage, it must implement the `LocalStorageData` interface by defining two properties:

- `storageName`: the name of the box/container in storage.
- `storageKey`: a unique identifier for the object within that box.

### Example:

```dart
@HiveType(typeId: 1)
class RewardMemberRemoteResponse extends HiveObject implements LocalStorageData {
  @HiveField(0)
  final int? id;

  @HiveField(1)
  final String? rewardName;

  RewardMemberRemoteResponse({this.id, this.rewardName});

  @override
  String get storageName => 'myRewards';

  @override
  String get storageKey => 'reward_$id';
}
```

## 🧱 Abstract `LocalStorageStrategy`

The `LocalStorageStrategy<T>` abstract class defines the base CRUD operations for local storage backends. You can implement your own strategy by extending this abstract class. One default implementation provided is [`HiveStorage`](lib/library/hive_storage.dart).

---

## 🚀 Usage Guide (CRUD Helpers with LocalStorage)

We provide a high-level interface `LocalStorage` to simplify working with local storage using your `LocalStorageData` objects.

> ✅ By default, `HiveStorage` is used, but you can inject any strategy implementing `LocalStorageStrategy`.

### ✅ Getting Started

```dart
final localStorage = LocalStorageImpl(); // or use injection
```

You can now use this instance to perform CRUD operations.

---

### 1. `save`

Saves a single item.

```dart
final data = RewardMemberRemoteResponse(id: 1, rewardName: 'Reward 1');
final isSuccess = await localStorage.save(data);
```

---

### 2. `get`

Retrieves a single item based on its `storageName` and `storageKey`.

```dart
final result = await localStorage.get(RewardMemberRemoteResponse(id: 1));
```

---

### 3. `delete`

Deletes a single item.

```dart
final isSuccess = await localStorage.delete(RewardMemberRemoteResponse(id: 1));
```

---

### 4. `getAll`

Retrieves all items within the same `storageName`.

```dart
final result = await localStorage.getAll(RewardMemberRemoteResponse());
```

---

### 5. `getList`

Retrieves a list of items grouped under a shared `storageKey`.

```dart
final result = await localStorage.getList(RewardMemberRemoteResponse(id: 1));
```

---

### 6. `saveList`

Saves a list of items at once.

```dart
final rewards = [
  RewardMemberRemoteResponse(id: 1, rewardName: 'Shirt'),
  RewardMemberRemoteResponse(id: 2, rewardName: 'Cap'),
];

final result = await localStorage.saveList(rewards);
```

---

### 🧩 Custom Storage Strategy (Optional)

You can provide your own storage strategy:

```dart
await localStorage.save(data, storage: MyCustomStorage());
```

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This architecture provides a clean and flexible way to manage local storage using the **Strategy Pattern**. By implementing `LocalStorageData` and utilizing the provided helpers, you gain:

- ✅ Backend flexibility (e.g., easily swap Hive with another storage solution)
- ✅ Consistent interface for CRUD operations
- ✅ Reusable and testable codebase

> Build your own storage strategies, implement custom serializers, or add encryption — all while using the same consistent interface.
